globs:
    - "**/*.swift"

- Prefer small, focused files.
- Name reducers as {Feature}Reducer.swift.
- Views live with their feature. Add Preview providers.
- Avoid force unwraps. Use guard/if let.
- Keep public APIs documented with brief docstrings.
- Use SF Symbols for icons.
- When creating a new Swift file, include this header at the top:

  //  ${FILE_NAME}
  //  ${PROJECT_NAME}
