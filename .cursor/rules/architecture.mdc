- Use TCA for all feature state. One reducer per screen or card.
- Use Clean modules: App, Features, Core, Platform, Testing.
- Interactors live in Core/Domain. They are pure. No UIKit/SwiftUI in Core.
- Use dependency injection via TCA @Dependency and DependencyValues.
- No singletons. Use DI or environment.
- Keep files short. Prefer composition over large reducers.
- Keep UI logic in Views. Keep business rules in Reducers/Interactors.
- Support preview data for all views.
