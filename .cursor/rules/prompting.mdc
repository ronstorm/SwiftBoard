description: How to prompt Cursor AI with IDs.
globs:
    - ".cursor/**"
---
- Always reference IDs from the RD.
- Examples:
    - "Implement F-001 on S-002 with D-001 (Keychain). Add reducer tests."
    - "Build S-005 with cards from F-004 using D-002â€“D-004 and SWR F-007."
    - "Add tests for F-006 and user story US-008."
    - "Wire F-002 routing. Snapshot tests for entry (S-002, S-005)."
    - "Create Settings S-008 with F-008. Test toggles and sign-out."
- Keep prompts short and specific.
